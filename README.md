# Frankly Speaking
 A personal website curating stories on impactful initiatives that may shape the future of society. 

 This is also my first attempt in frontend web development. By custom building individual story pages, I hope to learn different skills in web development, and record my learning journey through my 'DevLog.html' (TBD).

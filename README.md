# Frankly Speaking
 A personal website curating stories on impactful initiatives that may shape the future of society. 

 A showcase of some of the most exciting developments in technology, education, etc., sourced from some of my favorite YouTube channels such as [Freethink](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freethink) and [Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/c/inanutshell). 
 
 I hope this project would enlighten myself and those who will visit the site one day, to understand the different facets of our modern problems, to be aware of interesting initiatives that are under development, and hopefully to empower us to improving the community around us. 

## Background
 This is my first attempt in frontend web development. By custom building individual story pages, I hope to learn different skills in web development, and record my learning journey through my `DevLog.html` (TBD).

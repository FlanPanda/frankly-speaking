# Frankly Speaking
 A personal website curating stories on impactful initiatives that may shape the future of society. 
 
 This is meant to showcase some of the most exciting developments in technology, education, etc., sourced from some of my favorite YouTube channels such as [Freethink](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freethink) and [Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/c/inanutshell). This is meant to educate myself and my audience possible solutions to some of our modern problems, and hopefully inspire us to think of more ideas when we encounter both old and new problems in our own communities. 

## Background
 This is also my first attempt in frontend web development. By custom building individual story pages, I hope to learn different skills in web development, and record my learning journey through my `DevLog.html` (TBD).
